## About
Find events and people nearby with Zipper! Effortlessly meet people, create, and discover events easier than ever before.

Zipper was a start-up that my friends and I started at the peak of COVID-19 with the goal of finding a solution to isolation. Unfortunately, we decided to move on from the project. There are a lot of good examples and resources for swift developers. Feel free to look around and take as you please!
